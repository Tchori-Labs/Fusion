Cache the AgentStore SQLite connection per project so the dashboard no longer reopens the database, re-runs migrations, and re-executes `PRAGMA integrity_check` on every `/api/agents` request. On large project databases this turned a sub-100ms call into multi-second latency that bled into every dashboard view fetching the agent list.
