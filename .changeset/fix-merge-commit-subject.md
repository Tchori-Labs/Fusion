Fix merge commits landing with the bare `feat(FN-XXXX): merge fusion/fn-xxxx` subject. Three fallback commit paths in the merger (auto-resolve-all-conflicts, `-X theirs/ours` side strategy, AI-agent-didn't-commit) now route through the same deterministic message builder as the happy path, so they pick up the AI-generated subject when available. When the AI subject summarizer returns null, the subject is now derived from the branch's first step-commit (with conventional-commit prefix stripped, plus `(+N more)` when multiple commits) instead of falling back to `merge <branch>`. Subject-summarizer timeout raised from 15s to 30s so slow-first-token providers complete instead of silently falling back.
