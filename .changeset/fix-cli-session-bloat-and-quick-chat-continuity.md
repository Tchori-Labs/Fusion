Fix two related CLI-session issues that caused resumed sessions to balloon in size and quick chat to lose continuity:

- Resumed pi-claude-cli and droid-cli sessions were re-sending the entire conversation transcript over stdin every iteration. `buildResumePrompt` anchored on the last user message and walked forward through preceding tool results, but the only user message stayed at index 0, so each turn duplicated the original query plus a growing stack of tool results into the on-disk session. Anchor on the last assistant message and slice forward instead, so only the genuine delta since the previous turn is sent.
- Quick chat created a fresh CLI session per user message and faked continuity by stuffing the last 50 messages into the prompt as a "## Previous Conversation" block. Replace that with real session continuity: `chat_sessions` gains a `cliSessionFile` column (migration 56) and ChatManager now reuses the existing pi SessionManager file when present, creating a fresh one on the first turn and persisting its path. The prompt now carries only the new user content.
