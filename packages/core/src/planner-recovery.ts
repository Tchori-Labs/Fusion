/**
 * FNXC:PlannerOversight 2026-07-04-12:00:
 * FN-7512 requirement: when the effective planner oversight level is
 * `"autonomous"`, the planner overseer may take BOUNDED autonomous
 * corrective action on the task's currently watched stage — inject steering
 * guidance into the active agent lane, retry a stuck/failed step, or request
 * a targeted fix for a detected error. Every action is capped by a
 * per-(task, watched-stage) attempt limit (`PLANNER_RECOVERY_MAX_ATTEMPTS`)
 * so recovery can never loop forever; once the budget is exhausted the
 * decision degrades to `"none"` with `exhausted: true` and the task is left
 * for human/other escalation. Merge/PR and destructive actions are
 * explicitly OUT of scope here (deferred to FN-7513's confirmation-gated
 * layer), and comprehensive human-control safeguards beyond a bare
 * `userPaused` skip are FN-7514's responsibility. This module is pure,
 * never-throws, and has NO engine imports — the engine-side dispatch lives
 * in `@fusion/engine`'s `PlannerRecoveryController`.
 *
 * Delivered-shape note: FN-7511 shipped its observation model in
 * `packages/engine/src/planner-overseer.ts` (`OverseerStageObservation` /
 * `OverseerWatchedStage` / `OverseerSourceLink`) rather than the
 * `PlannerObservationSnapshot` shape anticipated at spec time, and it has no
 * `getSnapshot`/`isActive`/`watchedStage === "none"` API — instead
 * `PlannerOverseerMonitor.observeTask()` returns one observation (or `null`
 * when there is nothing to watch). This module's `PlannerRecoveryObservation`
 * input type mirrors the delivered `OverseerStageObservation` field names
 * structurally (`stage`, `signal`, `oversightLevel`, `sources`) so the engine
 * controller can pass an `OverseerStageObservation` straight through without
 * an adapter; "no watched stage" is represented by passing `snapshot: null`.
