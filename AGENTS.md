# Project Guidelines

## Finalizing changes

When making changes that affect published packages, create a changeset file:

```bash
cat > .changeset/<short-description>.md << 'EOF'
---
"@dustinbyrne/kb": patch
---

Short description of the change.
EOF
```

Bump types:

- **patch**: bug fixes, internal changes
- **minor**: new features, new CLI commands, new tools
- **major**: breaking changes

Include the changeset file in the same commit as the code change. The filename should be a short kebab-case description (e.g. `fix-merge-conflict.md`, `add-retry-button.md`).

Only create changesets for changes that affect the published `@dustinbyrne/kb` package — user-facing features, bug fixes, CLI changes, tool changes. Do NOT create changesets for internal docs (AGENTS.md, README), CI config, or refactors that don't change behavior.

## Package Structure

- `@kb/core` — domain model, task store (private, not published)
- `@kb/dashboard` — web UI + API server (private, not published)
- `@kb/engine` — AI agents: triage, executor, reviewer, merger, scheduler (private, not published)
- `@dustinbyrne/kb` — CLI + pi extension (published to npm)

Only `@dustinbyrne/kb` is published. The others are internal workspace packages.

## Testing

```bash
pnpm test          # run all tests
pnpm build         # build all packages
```

Tests are required. Typechecks and manual verification are not substitutes for real tests with assertions.

## Pi Extension (`packages/cli/src/extension.ts`)

The pi extension provides tools and a `/kb` command for interacting with kb from within a pi session. It ships as part of `@dustinbyrne/kb` — one `pi install` gives you both the CLI and the extension.

Update it when:

- **CLI commands change** — if `kb task create`, `kb task list`, `kb task show`, `kb task attach`, `kb task pause`, or `kb task unpause` change their behavior, flags, or output, update the corresponding tool in `packages/cli/src/extension.ts`.
- **Task store API changes** — the extension calls `TaskStore` directly (`createTask`, `listTasks`, `getTask`, `addAttachment`, `pauseTask`). If these methods change signature or behavior, update the extension.
- **New user-facing features** — if a new CLI command is added that the chat agent should be able to use (task creation, status checking, automation control), add a tool for it.

**Don't** add tools for engine-internal operations (move, step updates, logging, merge) — those are handled by the engine's own agents.

The extension has no skills — tool descriptions, `promptSnippet`, and `promptGuidelines` give the LLM everything it needs.

## Git

- Commit messages: `feat(KB-XXX):`, `fix(KB-XXX):`, `test(KB-XXX):`
- One commit per step (not per file change)
- Always include the task ID prefix

## Settings

The following settings are available in the kb configuration (stored in `.kb/config.json`):

### `autoResolveConflicts` (default: `true`)

When enabled, the auto-merge system will intelligently resolve common merge conflict patterns without requiring manual intervention:

- **Lock files** (`package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock`, `Gemfile.lock`, etc.) — automatically resolved using the current branch's version ("ours")
- **Generated files** (`*.gen.ts`, `dist/*`, `coverage/*`, etc.) — automatically resolved using the branch's fresh generation ("theirs")
- **Trivial conflicts** (whitespace-only differences) — automatically resolved

When a merge encounters conflicts and the AI agent fails to resolve them on the first attempt, the system implements a 3-attempt retry logic with escalating strategies:

1. **Attempt 1**: Standard merge with AI agent using full context
2. **Attempt 2**: Auto-resolve lock/generated files, then retry AI with simplified context
3. **Attempt 3**: Use `git merge -X theirs` strategy for remaining conflicts

If all 3 attempts fail, the task remains in "in-review" for manual resolution. The per-task retry counter (`mergeRetries`) tracks how many attempts have been made.

To disable automatic conflict resolution and require manual intervention for all conflicts:

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "autoResolveConflicts": false
  }
}
```

### `smartConflictResolution` (default: `true`)

Alias for `autoResolveConflicts`. When enabled, enables automatic resolution of:
- Lock files using "ours" strategy (keep current branch's version)
- Generated files using "theirs" strategy (keep branch's fresh generation)  
- Trivial whitespace conflicts via `git diff-tree -w`

This setting is preferred for new configurations. If both settings are present, `smartConflictResolution` takes precedence.

### `requirePlanApproval` (default: `false`)

When enabled, AI-generated task specifications require manual approval before the task can move from "triage" to "todo". 

**How it works:**
- After the AI reviewer approves a specification, instead of automatically moving to "todo", the task remains in "triage" with status `"awaiting-approval"`
- Users can review the PROMPT.md in the task detail modal
- Users can click "Approve Plan" to move the task to "todo" and begin execution
- Users can click "Reject Plan" to discard the specification and trigger regeneration

To enable manual plan approval:

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "requirePlanApproval": true
  }
}
```
