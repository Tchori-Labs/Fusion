# Fusion changelog

User-facing release notes aggregated across all packages. This file is auto-synced from each `packages/*/CHANGELOG.md` by `scripts/release.mjs` — do not edit by hand.

## 0.73.0-beta.0

### Highlights
- Breaking: Planning Mode is now an open-ended interview you explicitly validate — no more fixed depth caps or checkpoint gating
- Security: in-app reports scrub the full activity trace before filing, so paths and tokens never leave your machine
- Pick your update track — beta or stable release channels in Settings or `fn update --channel <stable|beta>`
- Your custom workflow now fully drives the board — cards move through the columns you actually defined, not a fixed six
- Review artifacts: auto-generated task verification videos and deliverable galleries in a new Quality hub

### New
- Beta and stable release channels — choose your update track in Settings or `fn update --channel <stable|beta>`.
- Your workflow now drives the board — cards move through the columns you define, not a fixed six-column set.
- Review artifact controls: auto-generated task verification videos and deliverable galleries in a new Quality hub.
- Guided in-app Bug/Feedback/Idea/Help reporting with screenshots, GitHub Issues or Discussions filing, and roadmap deduplication.
- Mission auto-merge override — bundle a mission's features onto one branch and one PR.

- Planning Mode simplified into a sequential flow: question → plan review → refine/validate.

### Fixed
- Planning Mode: dozens of reliability fixes — stable timers and session restore across refresh/stop/resume, reliable refinement submission on mobile, synced questions and running plan, durable initial plan generation, mobile/tablet layout, collapsed history by default, and rejection of truncated final plans.
- SQLite→PostgreSQL migration status now surfaces on the dashboard while cutover is pending; several PostgreSQL stability fixes (permission errors reading migration health, concurrent project-init races, NUL-byte crashes in chat/mailbox writes, restored activity logs).
- Workflow/board fixes: no-merge workflows now finish in their completion column, custom Merging columns receive cards correctly, hold nodes no longer crash the Pull Request workflow, and tasks without a saved workflow selection can move again.
- Fixed Codex weekly usage reporting, Grok/Claude MCP bridge packaging, OMP (Oh My Pi) model runtime failures, and GitHub Copilot re-login banner persistence.
- Task detail and Kanban UI polish: consistent action-button sizing across themes/breakpoints, mobile swipe settling on one column, cost badge placement, and deduplicated agent name badges.
- Restored translations (zh-CN/zh-TW roadmap duplicate label; Settings Configuration Versions across five locales).
- Duplicate-task guards: prevented duplicate follow-ups from retried steps, cross-parent diagnostic duplicates, and stale "needs your decision" states.

- Windows update timeouts extended; Compound Engineering personas restored in npm installs; Claude CLI pi extension load fixed via SDK dependency pinning.

### Breaking
- Removed the Planning Mode deepening checkpoint and fixed interview depth caps — plans are now validated explicitly by the operator instead of by AI completion.

### Security
- In-app report filing now scrubs the full activity trace before it leaves your machine, so paths and tokens never reach the pipeline.

### Internal
- Review gates (plan/code/browser) now run exclusively as workflow-graph nodes; the legacy in-session step reviewer and its git-reset rewind path are removed.
- Tasks left mid-flight by an older Fusion version are now adopted cleanly on upgrade instead of getting stuck.

## 0.72.0

### Highlights
- OpenAI Codex sign-in now front-and-center in onboarding quick start

### New

- Fixed elevated Windows desktop boot failing with a "directory name is invalid" error when starting embedded PostgreSQL
- Hardening pass across onboarding, Git preflight, and Windows PostgreSQL lifecycle based on review feedback

### Breaking
- Existing non-UTF-8 embedded PostgreSQL clusters are not retroactively fixed; affected installs must delete their local embedded-postgres data directory to complete the repair

## 0.71.0

### Highlights
- See live progress instead of a blank screen during database migrations on boot
- Desktop launch screen now shows migration status and won't time out mid-migration
- Fixed a first-boot crash migrating legacy SQLite data containing NUL characters

### New

## 0.70.1

### Highlights
- Fixed packaged desktop app crashing on first launch due to missing PostgreSQL migrations
- Fixed PR-mode auto-merge failures in centrally-installed multi-project setups

### Fixed
- Packaged desktop builds no longer crash on first boot — the PostgreSQL migration files that power Local mode schema setup are now correctly bundled into the app.
- PR-mode auto-merge no longer fails with a "Could not determine repository" error when running centrally-installed, multi-project deployments; repository resolution now uses the correct per-project context instead of falling back to the wrong working directory.
